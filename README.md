 Stock Analysis with VBA
[VBA Challenge](https://github.com/tsmtruong/stock-analysis/blob/main/vba_challenge.xlsm)

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this porject is to refractor VBA code that collects information from the years 2017 and 2018. The point of this project was to determine if the stocks were work investing in. The purpose of refractoring the code was to make it a more effiecient format to have the code run more seamlessly.

## Analysis of Results

### Analysis of Code
This is the code that I refractored


Sub AllStocksAnalysisRefactored()
    Dim startTime As Single
    Dim endTime  As Single

    yearValue = InputBox("What year would you like to run the analysis on?")

    startTime = Timer
    
    'Format the output sheet on All Stocks Analysis worksheet
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    
    Range("A1").Value = "All Stocks (" + yearValue + ")"
    
    'Create a header row
    Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"
    Cells(3, 2).Value = "Total Daily Volume"
    Cells(3, 3).Value = "Return"

    'Initialize array of all tickers
    Dim tickers(12) As String
    
    tickers(0) = "AY"
    tickers(1) = "CSIQ"
    tickers(2) = "DQ"
    tickers(3) = "ENPH"
    tickers(4) = "FSLR"
    tickers(5) = "HASI"
    tickers(6) = "JKS"
    tickers(7) = "RUN"
    tickers(8) = "SEDG"
    tickers(9) = "SPWR"
    tickers(10) = "TERP"
    tickers(11) = "VSLR"
    
    'Activate data worksheet
    Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
    
    'Get the number of rows to loop over
    RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ''1a) Create a ticker Index
tickerIndex = 0

'1b) Create three output arrays
Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single

''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
' If the next row’s ticker doesn’t match, increase the tickerIndex.
For i = 0 To 11
    tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    tickerStartingPrices(i) = 0
    tickerEndingPrices(i) = 0
Next i

''2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
For i = 2 To RowCount

    '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
    tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
    
    '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
    'If  Then
    If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
    End If
    
    '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
    'If  Then
     If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
     End If

        '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
         If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        End If

Next i

'4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
For i = 0 To 11
    
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Cells(3 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
    Cells(3 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
    Cells(3› + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
    
Next i
    
    'Formatting
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Range("A3:C3").Font.FontStyle = "Bold"
    Range("A3:C3").Borders(xlEdgeBottom).LineStyle = xlContinuous
    Range("B4:B15").NumberFormat = "#,##0"
    Range("C4:C15").NumberFormat = "0.0%"
    Columns("B").AutoFit

    dataRowStart = 4
    dataRowEnd = 15

    For i = dataRowStart To dataRowEnd
        
        If Cells(i, 3) > 0 Then
            
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbGreen
            
        Else
        
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbRed
            
        End If
        
    Next i
 
    endTime = Timer
    MsgBox "This code ran in " & (endTime - startTime) & " seconds for the year " & (yearValue)

End Sub


### Pros and Cons of Refractoring Code
Refractoring code has many advantages, it makes the code cleaner and easier to organize. This design makes it easier to debug and improve upon the code with a little bit more ease. It also helps when there are multiple different people working on the code at different times allowing for faster and easier readability. The cons of refacoring code are that the code may be too large to refractor, there may not be prior tests run for codes which would pose as a risk for refractoring.

### Refractored Stock VBA
The refractored stock VBA macro ran faster than previously. That was the largest benefit from the refractoring. While the old macro ran for a little over a second the new macro runs for about one fourth of the time.
